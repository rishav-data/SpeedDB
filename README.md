SpeedDB — A TCP Encrypted Toy Database With a Chaotic GUI
A fully unserious student project built with a very serious tech stack.

If you would like to add audio and clips for the UI to work properly , put a speed image in the clips folder and vlc clips in the same folder and mp3 files in the audio subfolder inside the clips folder and you are good to go. Just run dbaccess.py and the server will autolaunch.
